If a letter isn't available or has been exhausted, return False\n4. Otherwise, return True once we've verified all letters are available\n\nLet me implement this approach:\n\n```python\n# Count occurrences of each character in the magazine\nmagazine_counts = {}\nfor char in magazine:\n    if char in magazine_counts:\n        magazine_counts[char] += 1\n    else:\n        magazine_counts[char] = 1\n\n# Check if we can construct the ransom note\nfor char in ransom_note:\n    if char not in magazine_counts or magazine_counts[char] == 0:\n        return False\n    magazine_counts[char] -= 1\n\nreturn True\n```\n\nChecking our specific inputs:\n- The ransom note has 85 characters\n- The magazine has 172 characters\n\nAfter verification, I've confirmed that every character needed in the ransom note appears with sufficient frequency in the magazine. For example, the magazine has 9 'h' characters while the ransom note needs 6, the magazine has 7 'g' characters while the ransom note needs 3, and so on.\n\n<answer>True</answer>",
