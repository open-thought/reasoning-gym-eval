Must be a positive integer.\n\nOutput:\n    return (dict): A dictionary with one key:\n    - distinct_ways (int): The number of distinct ways to climb the staircase.\n\nGiven the following output:\n\n{'distinct_ways': 121393}\n\nCan you predict a feasible input without writing any code? Please reason and put your final answer in the form of a JSON object, even if the there is only one input variable, with keys strictly matching the input variables' names as specified.\n\nTip: Here is a reference code snippet for this question.
